    reused

SYNOPSIS
        package MyApp;
        use Moose;
        use namespace::autoclean;

        use Catalyst qw/
            +CatalystX::SimpleLogin
            Authentication
            Session
            Session::State::Cookie
            Session::Store::File
        /;
        extends 'Catalyst';

        );

        __PACKAGE__->setup;

DESCRIPTION
    CatalystX::SimpleLogin is an application class Moose::Role which will
    inject a Catalyst::Controller which is an instance of
    CatalystX::SimpleLogin::Controller::Login into your application. This
    provides a simple login and logout page with only one line of code.

REQUIREMENTS
    A Catalyst application
    Working authentication configuration
    Working session configuration
    A TT view

CUSTOMISATION
    CatalystX::SimpleLogin is a prototype for CatalystX::Elements. As such,
    one of the goals is to make it easy for users to customise the provided
    component to the maximum degree possible, and also, to main a linear
    relationship between effort invested and level of customisation
    achieved.

COMPONENTS
    *   CatalystX::SimpleLogin::Controller::Login - first point of call for
        customisation. Override the action configs to reconfigure the paths
        of the login or logout actions. Subclass to be able to apply method
        modifiers to run before / after the login or logout actions or
        override methods.

    *   CatalystX::SimpleLogin::TraitFor::Controller::Logout - provides the
        "logout" action and associated methods. you can compose this
        manually yourself if you want just that action.

    *   CatalystX::SimpleLogin::TraitFor::Controller::Login::WithRedirect -
        provides the "login" action with a wrapper to redirect to a page
        which needs authentication, from which the user was previously
        redirected. Goes hand in hand with Catalyst::ActionRole::NeedsLogin

    *   CatalystX::SimpleLogin::Form::Login - the HTML::FormHandler form for
        the login form.

    *   Catalyst::ActionRole::NeedsLogin - Used to cause a specific path to
        redirect to the login page if a user is not authenticated.

TODO
    Here's a list of what I think needs working on, in no particular order.

    Please feel free to add to or re-arrange this list :)

    Fix extension documentation
    Document all this stuff.
    Examples of use / customisation in documentation
    Fixing one uninitialized value warning in LoginRedirect
    Disable the use of NeedsLogin ActionRole when WithRedirect is not loaded
