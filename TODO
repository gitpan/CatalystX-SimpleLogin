06:01 <@gshank> t0m: I was playing with SimpleLogin
06:01 <@gshank> t0m: I think we should avoid using tt files completely and just use string references
06:02 <@gshank> my $rendered_form = $form->render; $c->stash( template => \$rendered_form );
06:03 <@gshank> also I think moving some things from the controller to the form would make for better factoring
06:04 <@gshank> then configure the form with form_args => { } or something
06:04 <@gshank> would also allow easier customizing
06:07 <@gshank> also should use the result objects. they're better for persistent forms.s
12:49 <@t0m> gshank: cool. No (or at least I _want_ user templateable element rendering - but what I have right now is poop, sure - how to output stuff is the first thing to fix after I ship 
             a first useable version), agree, argree, agree (re other points)
